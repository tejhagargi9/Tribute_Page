    <p id="storyquestion"> <u> How Great Journey of <i> Virat Kohli Begun </u> </i> </p>
    <div class="storybox">
        <p>The great journey of Virat Kohli began when he first burst onto the international cricket scene. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, Kohli showed immense talent and passion for the sport from a young age. <br>

            Kohli's cricketing journey started at the junior level when he represented the Delhi Under-15 team. He quickly rose through the ranks and made his debut for the Indian Under-19 team in 2006. He played a crucial role in leading the team to victory in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia in 2008. His performances in the tournament caught the attention of the cricketing fraternity, and he was soon hailed as a future star of Indian cricket. <br>
            
            In the same year, Kohli made his international debut for the Indian cricket team in an ODI against Sri Lanka. However, it was in 2010 that he truly announced his arrival on the international stage. Kohli showcased his incredible talent and ability to chase down targets under pressure during the Asia Cup, where he scored back-to-back centuries against Pakistan and Bangladesh. He continued his excellent form and soon became a permanent fixture in the Indian team across all formats. <br>
            
            Over the years, Kohli's batting prowess and consistency reached unprecedented heights. He has an extraordinary record of scoring centuries across formats and holds numerous records, including being the fastest player to score 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, and 11,000 runs in One Day Internationals (ODIs). He has also been a prolific run-scorer in Test cricket and became the first player to score double centuries in four consecutive Test series. <br>
            
            Kohli was appointed as the captain of the Indian Test team in 2014 and took over the limited-overs captaincy in 2017. Under his leadership, the Indian team achieved several notable victories, including their first-ever Test series win in Australia during the 2018-2019 season. Kohli's aggressive and passionate style of play, combined with his exceptional batting skills, have made him one of the most respected and influential cricketers in the world. <br>
            
            Beyond his individual achievements, Kohli has played a significant role in shaping the Indian cricket team's culture and fitness standards. He has emphasized the importance of physical fitness, discipline, and hard work, setting a great example for his teammates.
             <br>
            Virat Kohli's journey is a testament to his unwavering dedication, immense talent, and remarkable consistency in the sport. His impact on Indian cricket has been immense, and he continues to be a role model for aspiring cricketers around the world.</p>
